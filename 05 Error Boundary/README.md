# Error Boundary in React

In React, Error Boundaries are special components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the crashed component tree. This helps prevent the entire application from crashing due to a single unhandled error.

```js
<ErrorBoundary />
```
